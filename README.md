## FlyLog

FlyLog is a pilots logbook app, built using Rails.

Pilots can sign up using their GitHub accounts or with an email address.

Once signed up, pilots can start logging their flights, and comparing their progress against other pilots.

## Usage

For now the app can be accessed through the github repo (https://github.com/achasveachas/FlyLog)

Clone the log and fire it up using the Rails Server.

Eventually it will be available via heroku
